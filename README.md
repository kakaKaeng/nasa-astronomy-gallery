# Nasa Astronomy Gallery
The Nasa Astronomy Gallery is a website that showcases stunning images of our universe and provides detailed information about celestial objects. The website was built using the Angular framework and leverages the powerful NASA API to source and display beautiful images of space captured by NASA's many space exploration missions.

The website is designed to be both visually stunning and highly informative, with each image accompanied by a wealth of information about the celestial object it depicts. Users can easily navigate through the website to discover new images and learn about the wonders of our universe.

The website's front-end was developed using Angular, which allowed for rapid development and seamless integration of the NASA API. The back-end uses the NASA API to dynamically source and display new images and information as they become available.
